Rescaling the effective probability distribution defined in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Pna} for the ground state of the $t-V$ model at half-filling demonstrates the approximate proportionality relation $P_n \sim (P_{n,\alpha})^{1/\alpha}$ for interaction strengths corresponding to the charge density wave (top row, $V/t=10$), Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid (middle row, $V/t=-1.5$) and cluster phases (bottom row, $V/t=-10$) for \ren indices $\alpha=1,2,5,10$. $\mathcal{A}_\alpha^{-1} = \sum_n (P_{n,\alpha})^{1/\alpha}$ is a normalization constant and $P_{n,\alpha}$ is defined in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Pna}. The shape of the distributions and their connection to the physical ground states of the $t-V$ model is discussed in the text.
