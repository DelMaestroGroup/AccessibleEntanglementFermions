The effective probability distribution $P_{n,\alpha=2}$ for the ground state of the $t-V$ model at half-filling and for different interaction strengths $V/t$ in the TLL phase is  rescaled as $[P_{n,2}]^{K}$, were $K$ is the corresponding Luttinger parameter computed from Eq.~\eqref{eq:KtV}.  While the probabilities seem to show collapse near the middle of the
distribution where $n \simeq N/2$, the inset shows strong additional $K$ dependence of the
probability for fixed particle number $n=8$ in $A$. As discussed in the text,
this lack of collapse is due to the subleading interaction dependent
corrections to the asymptotic scaling of the variance $\sigma^2$ in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:sigma2prediction}
