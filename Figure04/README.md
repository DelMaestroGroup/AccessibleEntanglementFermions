Difference between the von Neumann and accessible entanglement entropies $\Delta S_1 = S_{1}-S_{1}^{\rm acc}$ (large circles) and the Shannon entropy of a Gaussian distribution, $\frac{1}{2} \ln 2 \pi e \sigma^2$ (small circles) as functions of interaction strength $V/t$. Results were determined via exact diagonalization for the ground state of Eq.~\eqref{eq:H-tV} with $N=15,16$.  The observed agreement between the large and small symbols demonstrates the rapid convergence of $P_n$ to a Gaussian distribution as seen in the inset where $\mathcal{N}(\expval{n},\sigma^2)$ is a normal distribution with the same mean and variance as $P_n$.  Solid lines are computed from the
theoretical variance of the number of fermions in region $A$ inside the
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase $\sigma^2 = K \sigma^2_{FF}$, where $K$ is the Luttinger parameter computed via Eq.\eqref{eq:KtV} and $\sigma^2_{FF}$ is the exact variance for free-fermions ($V/t = 0$).
