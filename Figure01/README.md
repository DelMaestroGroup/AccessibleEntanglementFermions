Phase diagram of the $t-V$ model accompanied by pictures of candidate ground states for $N=2$ fermions on a $L=4$ site lattice with anti-periodic boundary conditions. For the purposes of measuring accessible entanglement, the lattice has been bipartitioned into spatial subregions $A$ (blue) and $\bar{A}$ (red), each of size $\ell = 2$. In the limit of strong attractive interactions where $V/t \ll -2$, the particles cluster together and there are $L$ equally probable configurations corresponding to all translations of the cluster.  At the first order phase transition where $V/t = -2$, all ${L}\choose{N}$ configurations are equally probable resulting in a flat state. In the TLL phase with $|V/t| < 2$,  particles are delocalized and we have included a characteristic state corresponding to free fermions $(V=0)$. In the limit of strong repulsive interactions where $V/t \gg 2$, fermions maximize their distance from each other resulting in a charge density wave (CDW) phase. The open and closed circles on the $V/t$ axis denote a first order and continuous phase transition, respectively.
