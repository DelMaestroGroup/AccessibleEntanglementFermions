The filling fraction dependence of the variance $\sigma^2$  (black
    dots) of the  particle number distribution $P_n$ compared to that computed
    from the difference between the (exponentiated) accessible and spatial
    entanglement entropies for $\alpha=1$ (large circles) and $\alpha=2$
    (small circles) using Eq.~\eqref{eq:sigma2DeltaS}.  Exact diagonalization
    results in the ground state of the $t-V$ model with $V/t = -1.5$ and $L=28$
    demonstrate consistency with the predicted asymptotic scaling function
    $\mathcal{F}(N, \ell)$ given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:sigma2prediction} where we have fixed $\ell = L/2$ (left panel) or set $\ell = N$ (right panel) and changed $N$ from $2\dots14$.  In order to reduce finite size effects, both of the partition size $\ell$ and the total number of particles $N$  are replaced by their corresponding chord length $X(\ell)=(L/\pi)\sin(\pi\ell/L)$ and $X(N)$, respectively.  The constants $\mathcal{B}_1=\left(\pi e\right)^{-1}$ and $\mathcal{B}_2=\left(2\pi \right)^{-1}$ are used to rescale the entanglement reduction to obtain a prediction for the variance $\sigma^2$.
