Interaction strength at which the maximum $S_{1}^{\mathrm{acc}}$ occurs as a function of the total number of particles $N$. Filed shapes $(N\le 15)$ were computed with exact diagonalization while the remaining symbols for $N\ge 15$ are the result of density matrix renormalization group calculations.  Finite size corrections are investigated via a 2-parameter fit of $\ln N$ vs. $\ln{(V/t - 2)}$ and support scaling toward the infinite size phase transition at $V/t = 2$.  Inset: The interaction dependence of $S_{1}^{\mathrm{acc}}$ for various $N$ in the neighborhood of $\tfrac{V}{t}\rvert_{\rm max}$ shows an evolving peak.
